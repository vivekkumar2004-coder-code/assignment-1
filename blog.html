    <h1>My Cutiest Friend- A short Story Of proposal</h1>
    <p>
      This is the first time i am saying something about my best friend in the
      form of a htm blog webapp. I will be talking about her in this blog and
      would probably describe her almost the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      It all began in my chemistry coaching classâ€”because letâ€™s be honest, <b>"The chemistry of a relationship often starts in chemistry tuition."</b>

      I used to roll up on my cycle, and so did she. But while I was busy chatting with every tuition-mate on WhatsApp, she was just another face in the crowd. No conversations. No interactions. She wasnâ€™t even on my radar.
      
      Fast forward to our batch of <b>2020-2022</b>, where most of our classes happened on Google Meet. One day, our sir asked a tricky question, and before I could even process it, she answered at the speed of light. Stunned, I blurted out, <b>"Sir, Google ki hai!"</b> But her reply? Brutal. The kind that makes you never want to cross paths again.<b>My enthusiasm for her? Completely boiled down.</b> 
      <br>
      <br>
      Then came <b>October 2021</b>. She finally got her first phone, something I only found out through our mutual friend, Anushka. I casually texted her, <b>"Congrats on the new phone!"</b>â€”and just like that, our conversations started flowing.
      
      <b>October 20th</b> was when things took a turn. On a whim, I decided to test the waters and proposed to her on<b>November 4th</b> , expecting a laugh or a straight-up rejection. Instead, the unexpected happenedâ€”<b>she said yes.</b>
      
      But hereâ€™s where I messed up. A few days later, I told her it was just a trial. Ouch. She cut me off, stopped talking, while I kept spamming,<b> "So sorry, Richa."</b>
      
      The twist? She had already caught feelings. And on November 21st, she turned the tables and proposed to me. This time, I didnâ€™t make the same mistake.
      
      <b>I said yes.</b>
      
      And just like that, we became best friends. ðŸš²ðŸ’™

    <p> <h3>What makes Her so Beautiful</h3></p>
    <ul>
      <li><h4>Confidence in herself</h4></li>
      <li><h4>Stands firm when right, never hesitate</h4></li>
      <li><h4>Humble and ego-free</h4> </li>
      <li><h4>Loves deeply and wholeheartedly</h4></li>
      <li><h4>Genuine, not materialistic</h4></li>

    <h1>Our Bonding- Long Distance Relationship -</h1>
    <p> It was the 7<sup>th</sup> of March when all our exams were over. Due to the lockdown, I wasnâ€™t well-prepared for my engineering entrance exams. So, I decided to move to Kota, Rajasthan, and enrolled in *Resonance* for coaching. It was a tough journey, especially handling loneliness in a new city. But she never made me feel alone.
      We spent hours on video calls, supporting each other, and everything was going well. However, after some days, the food in Kota made me sick, and I suffered a lot. Eventually, I decided to return to my hometown, Kolkata.
      
      By the way, I forgot to mentionâ€”I am from Kolkata, and she is from Bihar. I had spent a part of my childhood in Darbhanga, Bihar, since my father was posted there. From then until now, we have remained the best of friends. In fact, I admire her as more than a friendâ€”she is my inspiration and my love</p>
    <h3>Perks of a Long-Distance Relationship </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Boring at times, but a true test of loyalty</li>
      <li>Efforts matter more than anything</li>
      <li>Improves time management skills</li>
      <li>Learning to have fun in the smallest moments</li>
      <li>Online games helped strengthen our bond</li>
      <li>Ignoring a call is never a solutionâ€”communication is key</li>
    </ol>

    <p> These are the raw moments of our first meeting after three years. We went on a date and enjoyed pizza and biryani together. I stayed for three days, and our meet-up was a sudden plan with only a <b>30% chance</b> of happeningâ€”but still, I made it! </p>

<p> She told me,<b> "On your visit to my home, I will pay for you,"</b> and she did. She surprised me with a Sonata watch and some stylish shirts, which were quite expensive. I was overwhelmed with joy and couldn't hold back my tears. That day, I realized that this woman is a <b> wholesome package of goodness</b>. Now, it's my turn to give her some gifts when she visits Kolkata. </p>

<h3>Feeling lucky to have such an amazing girl in my life! ðŸ’–</h3>

<p>Thatâ€™s all about my cute girlfriend. Thanks for reading! ðŸ˜Š</p>
